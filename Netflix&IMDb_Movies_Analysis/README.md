# Netflix & IMDb Movies Analysis - TODO List

## Project Overview
Complete a comprehensive analysis of Netflix movies and TV shows data, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights on genres, ratings, trends, and more.

## Data Understanding
- [ ] Inspect the dataset structure (columns, data types, shape)
- [ ] Understand each column's meaning and potential use
- [ ] Check for IMDb integration or additional data sources if needed

## Data Cleaning
- [ ] Handle missing values (e.g., director, cast, country, date_added, rating, duration)
- [ ] Remove duplicates if any
- [ ] Standardize data formats (e.g., date_added to datetime)
- [ ] Clean and standardize categorical columns (e.g., listed_in genres)
- [ ] Handle outliers in numerical columns (e.g., release_year)
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Analyze distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
- [ ] Examine release year trends
- [ ] Investigate top countries producing content
- [ ] Analyze rating distributions
- [ ] Explore genre popularity (listed_in column)
- [ ] Check for correlations between variables

## Specific Analyses
- [ ] Genre Analysis: Most popular genres, genre combinations
- [ ] Rating Analysis: Content ratings by type, trends over time
- [ ] Temporal Analysis: Content addition trends, release year patterns
- [ ] Director/Cast Analysis: Top directors, most frequent actors
- [ ] Duration Analysis: Movie lengths, TV show seasons
- [ ] Country Analysis: Content by country, international trends

## Visualizations
- [ ] Create bar charts for top genres, countries, ratings
- [ ] Line plots for content additions over time
- [ ] Histograms for release years and durations
- [ ] Pie charts for content type distribution
- [ ] Heatmaps for correlations or genre combinations
- [ ] Scatter plots for relationships (e.g., duration vs rating)

## Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Sentiment analysis on descriptions (if applicable)
- [ ] Clustering analysis for content grouping
- [ ] Predictive modeling (e.g., predict ratings based on features)
- [ ] Compare Netflix trends with IMDb ratings (if data available)

## Insights and Conclusions
- [ ] Summarize key findings
- [ ] Identify trends and patterns
- [ ] Provide recommendations or business insights
- [ ] Document limitations and potential improvements

## Documentation and Presentation
- [ ] Add detailed comments and markdown explanations in the notebook
- [ ] Create a summary report or presentation
- [ ] Ensure code is clean, modular, and well-documented
- [ ] Test all analyses and visualizations for accuracy

## Final Steps
- [ ] Review and refine all analyses
- [ ] Optimize code for performance if needed
- [ ] Prepare for sharing or deployment
